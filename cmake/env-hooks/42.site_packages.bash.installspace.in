# For catkin it is simpler to do add site-packages to PYTHONPATH in _setup_util.py.in than us doing it from here...
# but until catkin does this by default, the proper way from outside catkin is probably a env-hook

##Documentation:
#  The colon command simply has its arguments evaluated and then succeeds.
#  It is the original shell comment notation (before '#' to end of line). For a long time, Bourne shell scripts had a colon as the first character.
#  The C Shell would read a script and use the first character to determine whether it was for the C Shell (a '#' hash) or the Bourne shell (a ':' colon).
#  Then the kernel got in on the act and added support for '#!/path/to/program' and the Bourne shell got '#' comments, and the colon convention went by the wayside.
#  But if you come across a script that starts with a colon (Like this one), now you will know why. ~ Jonathan Leffler

# We should enable site-package only on devel space.
# Install space should behave like packages, everything in debian layout.
