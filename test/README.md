Valdating catkin_pure_python
============================

This directory aims at gathering tests to validate the behavior of catkin_pure_python by :
* working with __unmodified__ state of the art python packages
* "building" them (in catkin terminology) 
* make sure we can use them (somehow)

TODO : We should also use cookiecutter to get pure python package structure and make sure it also works with catkin.
If not we should provide here the required tools to make it so.

More tests will be added when we find more use cases that fit catkin_pure_python purpose
